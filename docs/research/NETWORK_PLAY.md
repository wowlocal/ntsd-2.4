## N1: Mac Winsock service (2026-10-01)

`OriginalMacWinsock` (NTSDMacPlatform) gives the original's WSOCK32 calls BSD
sockets, under the plan's declared Windows behaviour:

- WSAStartup answers wVersion 0x101 and wHighVersion 0x202 in a 400-byte
  WSADATA ("WinSock 2.0", "Running").
- gethostname, gethostbyname (IPv4 address words; 127.0.0.1 is 0x0100007f),
  inet_addr, inet_ntoa, htons.
- socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, TCP) handles from 0x100, step 4.
- bind with Windows-like reuse of TIME_WAIT ports, listen, accept (which
  inherits the listener's mode and selection), connect, send, recv (what has
  arrived; 0 at close), sendto as send on a stream socket, closesocket,
  FIONBIO and WSACleanup.
- WSAAsyncSelect: non-blocking. FD_ACCEPT is re-armed by accept, FD_READ by
  recv, and FD_CLOSE is posted once. Notifications go to the main queue as
  (window, message, socket, event | error << 16). Message 0 with events 0
  cancels; FIONBIO 0 is refused while a selection is active.

**Checks:** `OriginalMacWinsockTests` (3 tests, loopback) pass:

- startup, names and addresses;
- the host notification's order:
  - FD_ACCEPT, then accept;
  - the 14-byte greeting;
  - on the non-blocking accepted socket, recv returns WSAEWOULDBLOCK before
    the reply arrives, then the 77-byte reply;
  - the 3001-byte table;
  - a 10-byte partial receive;
  - FD_CLOSE delivered to the accepted socket, then recv 0;
- cancelling, FIONBIO, a refused connect and an unknown handle.

Not connected to the app yet (N2–N5). EXE envelope not recalculated.
